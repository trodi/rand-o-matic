# rand-o-matic

Collection of random puzzles that I wanted to solve programmatically for fun. My fallback language is Java, however I'm mixing both Java and Scala here.

It might be fun to turn this into a cmd line program that will list out all possible problems and allow you to run the problem, printing out the problem statement and the answer.

## Puzzles
* Scala
 * Roman numeral converter
* Java
 * Coins
 * Fill in the blank
