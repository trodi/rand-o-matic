Often we come across a problem that could easily be solved programmatically. Here are some of these that I've coded up for fun. My fallback language is Java so that's what I'm using even if these are all just basic scripts.

It might be fun to turn this into a cmd line program that will list out all possible problems and allow you to run the problem, printing out the problem statement and the answer.
